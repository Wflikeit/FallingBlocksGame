FallingBlocks is a fun and engaging game that involves the player avoiding falling blocks. The player can move in the x-axis, while if he wants to add more dynamics to the game then he also has the option of jumping using the spacebar. What's more, the game includes moving on backgrounds which makes it even more enjoyable.
